__SOLUTION__

So this time we have to find architect password. I tried to look more into `ps` but found nothing related to architect. So I got out of the `home/` directory and found other directories:
```bash
backup  bin  boot  dev  etc  home  lib  lib64  media  mnt  nohup.out  opt  proc  root  run  sbin  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var
```
First I tried `tmp` but nothing then I went to `etc/` and tried `grep -i arch *`, this command basically find the word `arch`, `-i` ignores the case meaning it will look for `arch` or `ARCH` and `*` meaning in every file. This command gives us:

```bash
morpheus@lxc-sysadmin:/etc$ grep -s -i arch *
deluser.conf:# exclude these filesystem types when searching for files of a user to backup
fstab:#//TheMAtrix/phone  /media/Matrix  cifs  username=architect,password=$(base64 -d "RkxBRy0yMzJmOTliNDE3OGJkYzdmZWY3ZWIxZjBmNzg4MzFmOQ=="),iocharset=utf8,sec=ntlm  0  0

We see an interesting base64 string decode it and you'll have the password
```bash
âžœ echo "RkxBRy0yMzJmOTliNDE3OGJkYzdmZWY3ZWIxZjBmNzg4MzFmOQ==" | base64 -d
FLAG-232f99b4178bdc7fef7eb1f0f78831f9
```

FLAG - `FLAG-232f99b4178bdc7fef7eb1f0f78831f9`
