__SOLUTION__

At first look it seemed okay to me and I thought those numbers in ingredient is our key so I did

```python
>>> d = [111,19,104,73,87,59,97,84,110,10,100,7,117,116,108,13]

>>> for i in d:
       print(chr(i))
```
But I got some random strings. So after googling I found out that there is actually a programming language called [`chef`](https://esolangs.org/wiki/chef)

This is really funny though. Then I use an [interpreter](https://metacpan.org/release/WERNERMP/Acme-Chef-1.03) to run the code

```perl
use Acme::Chef;

open my $fh, '<', "recipe.txt";
read $fh, my $code_string, -s $fh;
close $fh;

my $compiled = Acme::Chef->compile($code_string);
print $compiled->execute();
```

```bash
âžœ perl chef.pl
IWouldntEatThat
```

FLAG - `IWouldntEatThat`
